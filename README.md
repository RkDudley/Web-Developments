This project is about imitating a google webpage by using basic html and css skills

1. structure html by using div element to cover the image using a link to connect to picture website.
2. structure another div element to cover about the searching box using form and input elements. 
3. using a paragraph tag to descripe the moments in 2016

After finished all html structure, I use css style sheet to adjust the web page to look more a like google.com
